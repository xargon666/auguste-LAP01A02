# LAP 1 Code Challenge
As you have all been developing for a few weeks now, we can assume we are familiar with Google! So, let’s dive into it a bit more and rebuild it.
Try to make this look as much like Google as possible, use your developer tools skills to get some hints! \
You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

## Requirements
- Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
- Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
- Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.

***NB: You are creating your own API. It is up to you if you want to make use of the Google Search API in addition but it is not a requirement. Your API can have a limited selection of 'result' options that might be returned for a few search terms***

## Timeline
#### Wednesday
- Work on challenge
- 6pm: All work to have been pushed to a GitHub repo with review requested from another pair

#### Thursday
- 9am: Review the request sent to you by the other pair
- 10am: Meet with the other pair to discuss the comments that have been made
- 11am: Personal study time! Suggestion: take your feedback and use it to implement any changes and improvements

## Tips
- Create a new repo on GitHub early and push a basic README.md
- Very early on, before you've pushed any more code to GitHub, [make a new branch on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) called review/feedback/free-beer, whatever you like. Don’t push or merge anything to it, we’ll use it tomorrow for review purposes.
- When you find out who your review partners are, [add them as collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- When ready to submit for review, make all final commits and push to your working branch
- Make a Pull Request ***to*** your review branch, ***from*** your working branch
- **Do not** merge this PR!
- Request review on your PR by adding your review partners as reviewers by clicking the cog next to 'Reviewers' on the pull request page
- Keep an eye out in your own email and/or [GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications?query=reason%3Areview-requested) to see when you have been requested to review another team's work!
